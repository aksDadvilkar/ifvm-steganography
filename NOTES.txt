For capturing video frames: VideoCapture.grab can be used (can also be used with an MP4 file):

http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/videoio/doc/reading_and_writing_video.html

File format of captured images and their persistence in subsequent runs needs to be verified. [Confirmed that the set of frames returned using VideoCapture are always the same.]

Added demo of OpenCV frame extraction in Python 2.7. Check frames.py

Worth taking a look at for LSB text-on-image stego using OpenCV: https://github.com/RobinDavid/LSB-Steganography

For performing the hashing (key-making) from the Frame number we could use Python's hashlib: https://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib
Hashlib is a built-in module that supportss SHA1, SHA256 etc. We could use the in built functions to produce the appropriate hashes/messaage digests for our purposes.

A bette alternative would be to use PyCrypto for the above purpose rather than normal hashes. We could use one encryption algorithm. Pretty easy to run. I will add a sample.
